<p> John Edgar Hoover was born January 1st, 1895 in Washington D.C.. After graduating high school he attended night classes at George Washington University where he recieved his Masters degree in law. During his schooling he also worked at the Library of Congress. Afterr recieving his Masters degree, he found employment in the Department of Justice as a File reviewer. There he rose quicklyhrough the ranks and in two years had become the Special assistant to the Attourny General. It was while he worked here that he played a part in rounding up and deporting suspected communists after the First World War. In 1924 he was named the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (then known as the Burea of Investigation). Here he rebuilt the direputed organization after the chaotic and scandelous administration of Warren G. Harding. He rebuilt the FBI to be based on preofessionality, hiring and recruiting agents based on merit, and rigerous training and selection. He also established the FBI National Academy and the first FBI crime lab allowing agents to be trained effectively and allowing forensic science to be used in the solving of crimes. He became known for his investigations of Counterterrorism, Counterespionage, Counterintelligence, and Violent and Organized crimes. He served as the Director for the FBI for 48 Years, before passing away at age 77 on May 2nd, 1972.       </p>

<p> Becoming a Special Agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been a goal of mine for many years now. As such I find it interesting to learn about the lives of Agents and Directors who helped to shape it into the organization tat it is today. J. edgar Hoover is known by most as the founder of the FBI we know today, and that is because he took a government organization riddled with Corruption from the previous administrations and made it into a respectable investigative organization built on Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity. While he was far from perfect, and made questionable choices in the later years of his life and administration as Director of the FBI, I still respect him immensly for the work he did in turning the FBI into what it is today.  </p>
